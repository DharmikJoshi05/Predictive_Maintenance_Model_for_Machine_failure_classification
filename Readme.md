Predictive Maintenance Model for Machine failure classification

Developed a predictive maintenance model for machine failure classification using a dataset with seven independent variables. Performed binary classification, EDA, and data preparation, including normalization and train-test splitting. Implemented a Random Forest classifier for its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets. Achieved over 95% accuracy across evaluation metrics, improving machine performance and longevity. Utilized Terraform for infrastructure provisioning on Google Cloud Platform.
